REFACTOR:
Yes
- Clean melee code with local variables instead of mega if statements
- Calculate hitbox animation to match the timing of hitbox lifetime
- Move attack code to global status, so it's usable by both enemies and player
- Standardize movement structs
- Optimize enemy AI
	- Pretty sure they will tank performance on a potato, lol

Maybe
- Optimize multispread calculation
- Move hitbox collision checks to enemies (?)
	- This depends on how many enemies/bullets we want to have on screen at a time
- Redo whole attacking code base from scratch
	- Or just organize it so it's more readable
