FEATURES:
- Weighted camera
- Modify attacks ingame
- Perk/Buff system
	- Maybe just add to weapon stats, consuming the upgrade irrevocably
	- Weapons would probably have like a max upgrade amount
		- Could be increased by consuming upgrade instead of infusing it to the weapon
	- Buffs that apply to player are probably easiest to implement by adding extra functions to an array that gets run
	- Dodge perks???
- Dungeon generation
- Culling to walls and enemies
- Controller support
- Global tuning knobs EVERYWHERE

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFACTOR:
Yes
- Clean attack code with local variables instead of mega if statements
- Calculate hitbox animation to match the timing of hitbox lifetime
- Instead of having a billion if statement in hitbox object, add extra functionality as functions when spawning hitbox
	- These will be pushed into a behaviour array where they will be ran by the hitbox
	- Maybe separate arrays, one that runs every frame, one that is ran when hitting enemy/wall?
- Enemy state structure
- Enemy pathfinding/movement should be generalized
- Move all UI to a separate UI object
	- All draw functions should be in an array that gets looped
- Move FX drawing to a separate object that can handle vector draw calls

Maybe
- Optimize multispread calculation
- Move hitbox collision checks to enemies (?)
	- This depends on how many enemies/bullets we want to have on screen at a time
- Add possibility for anticipation time for attacking? (currently kinda hardcoded into enemies)
