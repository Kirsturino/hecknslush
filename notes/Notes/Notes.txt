---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFACTOR:
Yes
- Clean attack code with local variables instead of mega if statements
- Calculate hitbox animation to match the timing of hitbox lifetime
- Standardize movement and combat structs
- Remove switch case from spawnHitbox, add particle functions to ability structs
- Generalize dealDamage funtion
- Instead of having a billion if statement in hitbox object, add extra functionality as functions when spawning hitbox
	- These will be pushed into a behaviour array where they will be ran by the hitbox

Maybe
- Optimize multispread calculation
- Move hitbox collision checks to enemies (?)
	- This depends on how many enemies/bullets we want to have on screen at a time
- Add possibility for anticipation time for attacking? (currently kinda hardcoded into enemies)
