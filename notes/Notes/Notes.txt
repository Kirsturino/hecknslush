FEATURES:
Add complexity/FX to dodge until it feels good
- Maybe like an after image thingy

Add a hoverboad/zooming state if dodge is held long enough?
Enemy AI

REFACTOR:
Maybe refactor the way combos are incremented?
Clean melee code with local variables instead of mega if statements
Optimize multispread calculation

Movement is still probably jank???
