FEATURES:
- Weighted camera
- Dungeon generation
- Culling to walls and enemies
- Controller support
- Global tuning knobs EVERYWHERE

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
REFACTOR:
Yes
- Calculate hitbox animation to match the timing of hitbox lifetime
- Instead of having a billion if statement in hitbox object, add extra functionality as functions when spawning hitbox
	- These will be pushed into a behaviour array where they will be ran by the hitbox
	- Maybe separate arrays, one that runs every frame, one that is ran when hitting enemy/wall?
	
- Enemy state structure
- Enemy pathfinding/movement should be generalized

- Move FX drawing to a separate object that can handle draw calls from everywhere smoothly (for explosions and stuff)

- Generalize adding buffs
	- At least make it easy to add new structs and add functions to arrays


Maybe
- Optimize multispread calculation
- Move hitbox collision checks to enemies (?)
	- This depends on how many enemies/bullets we want to have on screen at a time
- Add possibility for anticipation time for attacking? (currently kinda hardcoded into enemies)
